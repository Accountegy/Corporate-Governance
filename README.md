# How could decentralization work?

- Peer to peer.
- Not reliant on a gateway.
- Self regulatory.
- Open source.
- Wholey owned and operated by stakeholders.
- Democratic in nature.


# How might that work inside an organization?

- Needs to be "bottom up".
- Every member can contribute.
- Variable compensation structure based on overall company performance + based on length of time at company and or experience level.  
- If merit is a persistant issue, the team member needs to leave the company or should be reassigned to a different team by the HR team.

## Teams
- Must consist of no more than 9 people. 
- Must have an odd number of people to ensure majority rule.
- Must have only one team leader.
- Team can vote by consensus to:
    -add a new position
    -subtract team members
    -elect their leader.
- Team members are compensated with a healthy base pay +  a bit of company stock. 
- Stock award increases every two years.

## Leaders
- Leaders need to want to lead and have an incentive to lead.
- Leaders extra incentive will be base pay increase + stock increase only for time served in the leadership position. 
- Team leaders are voted by team every year.
- Leadership terms are for one year. 
- Leader cannot serve more that 4 terms.
- Leaders must have worked at the organization for two years in order to be elibile to be a leader.
- Leaders serve as both scrum manager and HR for their teams. 

## CEO 
- Any leaders can run for CEO. 
- CEO must have served as leader for two years. 
- CEO elected by the employees from the leadership. 


## Shareholders
- The number of shares grows at a fixed number over time to allow the company to expand. 
- A % of the shares will be reserved for existing employees and growth and a % of the shares will be reserved for external investors. 
- An employee may buy or sell his or her shares at anytime.
- It is up to the employees of the company to create and manage value. 
- It is up to shareholders to determine that value. External investors have no say as to how the company operates other than to choose to hold their shares or sell their shares.
- Funding works similar to crowdfunding.
- Because variable compensation is based on length of time with the project, the people that had contributed to the project for the longest would have the most shares. This would adequately compensate founders and encourage them to stay on with a valuable project. 


# What problems does this solve?
- Leadership changes prevent organization from being trapped by a mono-culture and/or ineffective leaders.
- The direction of the company is being steered by the team members that choose to work there and the value they create together. 
-  All employees have a say as to the direction of the company when they pick their team leaders and vote on the CEO.
- Everyone at all levels is accountable to one another. 
- Rotates the burden of leadership to reduce burnout. 
- Decentralizes value creation. 
- Breaking up value and control eliminates lasting concentrations of power.
- Leaddership terms allow founders to work on ideas without having to bear the burdens that come with long term top level leadership duties.

# How would it evolve?

- Founder(s) initiates an idea to a buiness version of Github.
- Once idea reaches 9 collaborators, a vote is cast for the first leader (CEO).
- ICO is formed and offered. 
- Founders awarded an initial round of stock for being a founder. 
- Investors can either invest, or not invest making the shares valuable or not valuable. 
- The idea can progress and become more valuable or not progress and become worthless. 
- Habitual abusers of launching ideas that are never fulfilled will be banned from the platform. Investors are warned that investing could cause them to lose some if not all of their value.
